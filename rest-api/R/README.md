# Examples for R 

[R][1] is a system for statistical computation that can be used to plot data or analyze the gathered data for
statistical anomalies.
See also [Quick-R][2] for more information and help about R, as well as [Gardener's own][3]

Some need additional libraries that can be installed from within R

* RCurl : gathering of data via http. Unlike the simple `json_file <- "http:..."` RCurl also supports authentication which is needed for RHQ
* rjson : parse JSON into Lists and Vectors
