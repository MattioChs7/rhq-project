* Groupcontrol scripts *

Contributed by Wanja Pernath, wpernath @ github

Those scripts deal with resource groups and directed by a central shell script.
Before using the shell script you need to modify groupcontrol.conf to match
your installation.

Wanja has also created a presentation[1] that explains the scripts and the CLI further;
groupcontrol instructions start on slide 14.
